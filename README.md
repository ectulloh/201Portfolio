Connect 4 is a game where you match 4 tokens of your type in a sequence of four, before yuor opponent can or the baord fills up.
In this verison, you may play against another user, or the computer. 
Typing 'ctrl'+ 'c' at any time will exit the game.
First, enter a username to play under, that is less than 10 chararcters long.
Next, enter if you are playing against the computer, or another User by entering 'Computer' or Player, respectively.
If you are playing someone else, then it will then ask for thier username, under the same restrictions.
Next, the program will ask for the baord size. Boards must be greater than 4, as smaller board would not allow for anyone to win. Boards greater than 40 in dimension will distort the view and be difficult to play with.
Finally, you are playing the game itself. Congradulations, player one goes first!
The game will progress as normal until someone either wins, by connecting 4, or when the board fills up. The program will record the winner, if any, and ask if you would like to play again.
If you say no, by typing n, then have a great day!
otherwise, by typing y, it will send you back to the start and prompt you for a username once more.
